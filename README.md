EDA involved exploring the performance data to answer key questions, such as:
- Which department performs the best?
- Is performance related to level of education?
- Does salary influence performance?
- Are there any other factors that can influence performance in this company?

1. The sales department perform best with an average performance rating of 4.4
2. Performance is related to pevel of education since employees with Master's degree have an average performance rating of 4.1
3. The performance of employees with lower income does not necessarily influence their performance while those with higer income, yhe higher their slary, the higher their performance
4. The more project completed, the more the performance or productivity increases That is, low project completed, low rating; more project completed, more rating
5. The more the years spent in the company, the lesser the performance rating
